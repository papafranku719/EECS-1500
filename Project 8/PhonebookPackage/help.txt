Adding a Contact:

To add a contact into the Phonebook, you will need:
   1. A first name
   2. A last name 
   3. A phone number
   4. Some notes about your contact

Once you have these criteria met in your head, enter the corresponding criteria into their fields
(for example, your desired first name should go into the 'Enter a first name' field). Some notes
about entering into the fields:
1. The first name and last name should not exceed more than eight characters; otherwise, it
    not enter
2. The phone number should be entered in one of three ways:
    * XXX-XXX-XXXX
    * XXX-XXXX
    * (XXX)-XXX-XXXX
Upon entering a contact, the information will be displayed onto the table above the text fields.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Deleting a Contact:

If you somehow messed up your contact when you entered it (for example, you spelled one of 
the names wrong, or you put in a wrong phone number), you can easily delete the wrong entry
by selecting it (done via clicking onto the row that the contact is in) and then pressing the 'Delete'
button.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Sorting Your Contacts:

Your contacts within the table can be sorted through a manner of ways:
   1. Their first names
   2. Their last names
   3. By the time you entered the contact into the phonebook
   4. Their phone number(?)
   5. Their associated note(?)

This can be done by clicking on the top of the columns; this can sort by ascending or descending.

Saving Your Contacts:

Disclaimer: for a proper loading of contacts into the Phonebook, the path for saving will differ from
computer to computer. Wherever your copy of the Phonebook project is located will also be the 
location for your contacts' text file.

To save your contacts, click on the File button located at the top of the program. Two options will 
appear; the one desired for saving will, obviously, be titled 'Save'.

Once 'Save' is clicked, a File Explorer will open, allowing to save your file in any directory
**once again, to load in your contacts upon opening the Phonebook, save into your project's txt file**

The path desired for reloading your contacts will be:
C:\Users\Frank Parker\IdeaProjects\Project 8\src\PhonebookPackage\contacts.txt

----------------------------------------------------------------

Exiting the Phonebook:

To exit the Phonebook, there are two ways to do so:
   1. Click on the 'X' at the top right corner of the window
   2. Click on 'File', then click on 'Exit'. A confirmation window will pop up; just click 'OK', then the window
       will close.

Remember to save your contacts before exiting the Phonebook; otherwise, they will not load up when the
Phonebook is opened again.
